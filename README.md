# pyPPC
**Py**thon-based **p**rojector **c**ontrol for **P**anasonic beamers

## Goal
The goal of pyPPC is to get a working GUI for non-web-use of Panasonic projectors either by PJLink (TCP) or RS-232C (either UDP with a IP-to-RS232 server or serial itself).

## DEPRECATED
Just use [Packet Sender](https://github.com/dannagle/PacketSender) - maybe I will add a GUI one day, resembling Panasonic's HTML GUI for its projectors.
